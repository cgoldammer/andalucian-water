An overview of water reservoir levels in Andalucia, Spain.

Andalucia is going through an extended drought, and has seen
a dramatic depletion of water reservoirs. Here, we track publicly
available data on reservoir levels, and allow you to understand
the long-term trends.

Given the relative rainfall, we can predict the shortfall, which is
the expected reduction in overall reservoir levels (all in HM3). For now, we are using
a simple cubic prediction, but are working on making this more precise.`;

const descriptionScatter = `
The more it rains (as % of historical average, x-axis), the more the
        reservoir fills up (change in fill rate compared to last year=YOY,
        y-axis). We are using this relationship to predict the shortfall that is
        displayed above.
